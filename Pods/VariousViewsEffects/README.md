Various view's effects for iOS, written in Swift. Allows you to animate views nicely with easy to use extensions.
Currently supported animations:

- **Glass Break**

![Example](Resources/glass-break.gif?raw=true "glass-break")

- **Explode**

![Example](Resources/explode.gif?raw=true "explode")

- **Snowflakes**

![Example](Resources/snowflakes.gif?raw=true "snowflakes")

## Requirements
- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 9.2+
- Swift 4.1+

## Installing with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'VariousViewsEffects'
```

## Usage

```swift
view.explode()

view.breakGlass()

view.addSnowflakes(amount: 10, speed: .slow)
```

You can also customize how many pieces views breaks on, if the `view` which you call it on should be removed once animation is finished and also you can define a completion block which will be called after animation finishes.

```swift
view.explode(size: GridSize(columns: 15, rows: 21), removeAfterCompletion: true, completion: {
    print("animation finished")
})
```

Have fun! :)
